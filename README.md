# Memory card

In this game user must select all Pokemon cards in order to get maximum points. After picking one card, the deck shuffles randomly. If the user clicks on the same card twice, the current score resets.

Next tools were used for implementation:

- CSS;
- Javascript;
- React.

For using images of Pokemons for cards [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co) was used.

In this project I applied knowledge of using hook `useEffect()` for interaction with API. The only challenge during the implementation was keeping JSON-response in memory.
